This work/code is still in development. It is using dynamic structural equation modeling to look at lagged relationships within a Texas estuarine food web.
This work is expected to expand to look at multiple bays, multiple lags and multiple food webs (i.e., trophic models).
This current trophic model includes crustaceans (blue crabs and brown shrimp) serving as food sources for 5 predators: red drum, black drum, spotted seatrout
and two catfish species. Two abiotic factors of salinity and temperature are also included.
